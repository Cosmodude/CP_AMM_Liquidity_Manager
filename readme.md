Interview task: Raydium Add/Remove Liquidity
Write a Rust program which integrates with the Raydium CP-AMM on Solana Devnet and demonstrates the following:

Initialize a CP-AMM pool using an SPL token pair (you can use custom or existing Devnet SPL tokens)

Add liquidity to the CP-AMM pool by specifying the desired number of LP tokens.

Remove liquidity from the CP-AMM pool by redeeming the same amount of LP tokens.

(Bonus) Add and remove liquidity from the pool in a single Solana transaction.

You can choose if you want to do this off-chain (RPC client) or on-chain (CPI program).

Make a Pull Request to this repository with your solution.
